# AceBook

We have been tasked with developing a Facebook clone as a two week team project using Ruby on Rails working off a feature list rather than user stories. Our wonderful team is made up of:

* Benedetta Arinci (https://github.com/BeneArinci)
* Alastair Sumner (https://github.com/Sumner1185)
* Katie McDonagh (https://github.com/Katie-McDonagh)
* Anthony Donovan (https://github.com/ad13380)

# Initial Ideas

We spent the first afternoon of the project breaking down the first list of features that were provided for us into a number of tasks on our Trello board (https://trello.com/b/WN24QLdD/acebook-bits-please) and created an initial mock-up of how we expected our Acebook site to look:
